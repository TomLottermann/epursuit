epursuit
========

ePursuit is a "Real Life Scotland Yard" telephone bot and was created for the purpose of introducing freshmen to their new location.

It connects to Asterisk and sets up a telephone bot which is capable of calling all Mr X, recording where they are and sending these recordings to the detectives.

It is very easy to configure once you have Asterisk configured with the SIP provider of your choice.

*Note:* This project was created 4 years ago in a hurry and simply converted vom google code to github for nostalgic reasons
